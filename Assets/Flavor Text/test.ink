...
It was never about me.
Everything I did, I did for you.
All the things I wanted to do, I could do because you let me.
I barely had a choice because everything hinges on your family not finding out.
I feel like a dirty secret, Nick.
I was closeted too, and I hated myself for a long time because of it.
And having to pretend that we aren't a thing put me back in that dark place.
It sucks, but we've pretended so long that we're probably gonna put up the same front for the rest of our years in this goddamn town.
It made me fucking miserable, and it still does. But I sucked it up because I didn't want to ruin your life.
So don't tell me that this isn't about me because it was always about you!
